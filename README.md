# LKC Visualization - Across Data Categories

Visualize data from multiple 'categories' of data (e.g., fire, climate). Note that all data wrangling is conducted in the data category-specific repository so this repository should be _exclusively_ for visualization (i.e., its formal exported products are only graphs, not data files)
