# LKC Staff Sandbox

This folder is for fun, exploratory scripts written by LKC staff. These scripts may not adhere to a standard style convention or may contain design choices that prevent them from being run on anyone other than the original author's computer (e.g., hard-coded file paths, ambiguous input sources) but storing them in version control is (A) good practice and (B) creates a starting point if any of them warrant being refined and moved out of this sandbox into the 'actual' repository.

> TLDR: LKC Staff, put whatever code files you want in this folder!
